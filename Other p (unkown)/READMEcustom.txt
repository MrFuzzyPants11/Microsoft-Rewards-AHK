If you do not have a standard monitor size it is relatively easy to set up.

First: Navigate to rewards page and change zoom% until all 3 dailies are on screen at once, they don't have to be completely on screen but enough to click them.

Secondly:
	Run mousePosFinder.ahk and press F8 to show mouse coordinates. F7 terminates script.

Thirdly:
	Open Selected custom (MA for multilpe accounts) with file > open with > notepad (or prefered text editor)
	
Fourthly:
	With reference to the video guide (LINK TBD)
	Replace the variables with their corresponding value. They are labelled so you can ctrl + 3 and replace all similar at once.

Fifthly:
You're done! It's really that simple.
