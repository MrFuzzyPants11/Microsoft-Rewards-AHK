# BEFORE RUNNING Information:
## WHAT DOES THIS DO: 
	This script will complete all microsoft reward dailies as well the required searches for a 
	full daily rewards.

## HOW DO I USE IT: 
	- Activate the script by double clicking it or opening it with AutoHotkey. 
  - F6 to start the script (configurable hotkey)
  - F7 to terminate the script at any point. The script auto terminates once it completes but if 
	- something goes wrong use this. (configurable hotkey)

## WHAT CAN'T IT DO:
  Complete weekly or event rewards. These are not standardized and therefore cannot be 
	completed using this script

# BEFORE RUNNING Setup:
## APOLOGIZES:
	- This version of the script only works on Windows computers at 125% scale. 100% functionality for
	all resolutions will be added on December 14th however, there are no plans for 150+%

## MANDATORY SETUP: 
  - install autohotkey (https://www.autohotkey.com/) if you haven't already
      
  - Decide what version to use, 125% or 100% and prefered resolution (custom if none match display). 
	MA means multiple accounts if you would like to earn rewards on multiple accounts with one 
	activation of the script.

  - Make sure microsoft edge opens in full screen mode. (it should be closed when you run the 
	script)

  - In microsoft edge, on every account go to settings > Privacy, search, and services > Clear 
	browsing data: 'Choose what to clear everytime you close the browser'. Select everything, this 
	makes it run faster so you dont lag behind in the future

	- In microsoft edge, on every account go to settings > appearance. Set 'show favourites bar' to
	"ALWAYS"
  
  - Press ctrl+shift+i and click the icon to the left of the "element" (or "welcome" if this is 
	your first time opening it) tab. This is the icon that looks like a phone infront of a PC

## OPTIONAL SETUP:
  - Replace "F6" or "F7" hot keys by right clicking the file > open with > notepad (or prefered 
	text editor). and replace the F6 and F7 respectively on the lines marked ; HOTKEY

# AFTER RUNNING optional changes:
	- **If YOUR PC DOES NOT LOAD FAST ENOUGH:** You need to change the "Sleeps, value" to higher values 
	(they are in MS). You do this by right clicking the file > open with > notepad (or prefered 
	text editor). For all rewards it does not need to load the page for you to get credit so leave
	those as is. However opening the rewards menu, new searching tab, inspect menu, phone interface,
	and changing profiles does need to load completely
