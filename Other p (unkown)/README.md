# Other Monitor Sizes:
	If you don't have a monitor size or scale as in the other files it is releatively easy to create your own.

## First: 
	Navigate to rewards page and change zoom% until all 3 dailies are on screen at once, they don't have to be completely on screen but enough to click them.

## Secondly:
	Run mousePosFinder.ahk and press F6 to show mouse coordinates. F7 terminates script.

## Thirdly:
	Open Selected custom with file > open with > notepad (or prefered text editor)
	
## Fourthly:

	Replace the variables with their corresponding value. They are labelled so you can ctrl + F3 and replace all smilar at once.

## Fifthly:
	You're done! It's really that simple.
